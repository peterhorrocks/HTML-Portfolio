<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Alien</h3>
<p>Ground Breaking Horror Sci-Fri/Horror Movie. The first time I saw it was 1980. Scared the s%*t out of me. Was so intense.</p>
<h3>28 Days Later</h3>
<p>I'm not a great fan of post-apocalyptic films, but this one had the right ambience, great actors. Really Cool Zombie Movie</p>
<h3>Quatermass and the Pit</h3>
<p>Old film, but still has a scary element to it.</p>
