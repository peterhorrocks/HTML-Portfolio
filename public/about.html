<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I first learnt to program back in the 1980s, with BASIC. I then went onto a short course learning MS COBOL. By the late 1980s, I was working for an Insurance company programming with COBOL and ADABAS Natural. Many of you will probably have never heard of these.</p>

<p>I broke from computer programming to run a business importing goods from China and India, and we became quite successful. During this time I created our company's web site in 2001 using HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>I am now semi-retired but still have a great interest in programming. In the past few years, I have learnt Python and C, and created a desktop version of the original board game Escape from Colditz. It's prisoners against the Germans (the Computer). Workable. but still needs some tweaking.

<p>I am now doing this course, to revisit and enhance my knowledge of Web Development.</p>
